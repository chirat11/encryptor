## Usage

Using Encryptor is straightforward. Below are basic commands for encryption and decryption.

### Encrypting a File

```bash
encryptor encrypt --input yourfile.txt --output yourfile.enc
```

### Decrypting a File

```bash
encryptor decrypt --input yourfile.enc --output yourfile.txt
```

Replace `yourfile.txt` and `yourfile.enc` with your actual file names.

### Text Encryption

To encrypt a string of text:

```bash
encryptor encrypt-text "Your sensitive text here" --output encrypted.txt
```

To decrypt:

```bash
encryptor decrypt-text --input encrypted.txt
```

## Encryption Algorithms

Encryptor supports various encryption algorithms, each designed for specific use cases:

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. It offers strong security and performance.

### Argon2

Argon2 is a password hashing function that secures passwords against brute-force attacks. It is memory-efficient and resistant to GPU attacks.

### Dilithium

Dilithium is a post-quantum digital signature scheme. It provides strong security against quantum attacks.

### Ed448

Ed448 is an elliptic curve signature scheme. It offers fast performance and strong security.
